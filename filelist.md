* 'README.txt' 
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector. 
* 'features.txt': List of all features. 
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

## train
  *  'X_train.txt': Training set. 
  *  'y_train.txt': Training labels. 
  *  'subject_train.txt' Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
  
  ### train Inertial Signals
    *   body_acc_x_train.txt The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration along x axis.
